REUTERS/ Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoLONDON (Reuters) - Banks, law firms and other advisers stand to earn up to $963 million in fees from Takeda Pharmaceutical’s (4502.T) $62 billion takeover of drugmaker Shire (SHP.L), according to documents for the deal published on Monday. The deal will be the largest-ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and will lead to big payments to advisers working on both sides of the transaction.   The Japanese company expects spend about $733.4 million in fees and expenses in total, while London-listed Shire’s costs will range between $216.5 million and $229.5 million, the companies disclosed in the documents. Takeda’s team of advisers includes investment banks Evercore (EVR.N), JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Nomura while Shire’s line-up includes Citigroup (C.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Takeda’s single biggest expense will be its financing arrangements for the takeover which will cost it $386.6 million. That financing package includes a bridge loan of almost $31 billion from lenders including Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and MUFG.   Takeda is also spending $111.7 million on financial and corporate broking advice and $44.2 million on lawyers, the documents show. Its other costs include $24.3 million for accounting advice and $6.3 million to public relations consultants. Meanwhile, Shire estimates that it will pay banks as much as $150 million for their advice during the takeover, and up to $70 million to its lawyers.   Takeda still needs approval from European regulators and its investors for the deal to go ahead and said on Monday that it had scheduled a shareholder meeting for Dec. 5 for investors to vote on the takeover.

The EGM is to be convened at 10:00 a.m. on December 5, 2018 at INTEX Osaka, Hall 6B Zone.\\n \\n\\n The procedures and timings for shareholders to vote on the resolutions are set out in the notice of the EGM in the Circular. The Circular will shortly be available to view on the Company's website at www.takeda.com/investors/offer-for-shire.\\n \\n\\n “ The acquisition of Shire will accelerate our strategic transformation to create a stronger, more global and more competitive company with the financial strength to continue investing in delivering highly innovative medicines and transformative care to patients around the world,” said Christophe Weber, President and Chief Executive Officer of Takeda. “ With the date of our Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders now set, we are looking forward to continuing our dialogue with shareholders regarding the compelling strategic and financial benefits of this transaction. ”\\n \\n\\n Further to the announcement on October 26, 2018, Takeda and Shire have held discussions with the European Commission (“EC”) in relation to the future potential overlap in the area of inflammatory bowel disease between Takeda’s marketed product Entyvio (vedolizumab) and Shire’s pipeline compound SHP647, which is currently in Phase III clinical trials. As a result of those discussions, Takeda has offered commitments to divest SHP647 and certain associated rights, with a view to the EC granting a Phase I conditional clearance for the Acquisition and not initiating proceedings under Article 6(1)(c) of Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004. The EC will issue its decision in relation to the Acquisition on or before November 20, 2018 and an announcement containing the substance of that decision will be made in due course.\\n \\n\\n Subject to receiving the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals, Takeda intends that completion of the Acquisition will take place on January 8, 2019 or as soon as practicable thereafter following approval from the EC to proceed to completion. Further announcements will be made as appropriate.\\n \\n\\n Compelling Strategic and Financial Rationale for the Acquisition\\n \\n\\nTakeda also reaffirms the compelling strategic and financial rationale for the Acquisition:\\n \\n\\n\\nThe Acquisition will create a global, values-based, R&amp;D-driven biopharmaceutical company incorporated and headquartered in Japan, with an attractive geographic footprint and leading positions in Japan and the United States, respectively the third and first largest pharmaceutical markets globally.\\n The Acquisition will strengthen Takeda’s presence across two of its three core therapeutic areas - gastroenterology (GI) and neuroscience – and provide leading positions in rare diseases and plasma-derived therapies. Following completion of the Acquisition, Takeda will continue to focus on the acceleration of its oncology business, following its recent acquisition of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals. In addition, Takeda’s vaccine business will continue to address the world’s most pressing public health needs.\\n The Acquisition will also create a highly complementary, modality-diverse pipeline and a strengthened R&amp;D engine focused on breakthrough innovation. As a result of greater scale and efficiencies in commercial activities, the Acquisition will enable the combined group to further fuel its R&amp;D investment, better positioning Takeda to deliver highly-innovative medicines and transformative care to patients around the world.\\n In addition to the significant strategic benefits of the transaction, the Acquisition will also deliver compelling financial benefits for the combined group. The Acquisition is expected to deliver substantial pre-tax cost synergies of at least $1.4 billion each year by the end of the third fiscal year following completion1, with the potential for additional revenue synergies from the complementary geographic and therapeutic focus.\\n The Acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to underlying earnings per Takeda share from the first full fiscal year following completion and to produce strong combined cashflows. The Acquisition is also expected to be earnings accretive per Takeda share on a reported basis within three years post completion.\\n The Acquisition is expected to result in attractive returns for Takeda shareholders, with the return on invested capital (ROIC) expected to exceed Takeda's cost of capital within the first full fiscal year following completion.\\n\\n 1 This statement includes a quantified financial benefits statement which has been reported on under Rule 28.1 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers in the UK. Related reports can be found in the Rule 2.7 Announcement made by Takeda on May 8, 2018, as well as information regarding the method of calculation of the synergies and the costs to achieve such synergies.\\n \\n\\n\\n The substantial cash flow generation expected to result from the Acquisition will enable the combined group to de-lever quickly following completion. Takeda intends to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a target net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.0x or less within three to five years following completion of the Acquisition, without the need to issue new shares. To help accelerate the de-leveraging process and ensure an optimal business mix, Takeda will consider selected disposals of non-core assets.\\n An enlarged and well-positioned combined portfolio will strengthen the combined group’s ability to invest in the business and deliver returns to Takeda shareholders. Takeda’s dividend policy has remained consistent over the past 9 years, with an annual dividend of JPY 180 per share having been paid to Takeda shareholders. Takeda has remained disciplined with respect to the terms of the Acquisition and intends to maintain its well-established dividend policy of JPY 180 per share.\\n The Acquisition is expected to result in Takeda being the only pharmaceutical company listed on both the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan, where it will continue to have its primary listing, and the New York Stock Exchange in the U.S., enabling it to access two of the world’s largest capital markets.\\n\\n Shire Scheme Document and Shareholder Meetings\\n \\n\\n Takeda also notes that Shire has published its scheme document (the “Scheme Document”) in relation to the Acquisition and plans to hold its shareholder meetings in connection with the Acquisition on December 5, 2018, following Takeda’s EGM.\\n \\n\\n The Scheme Document and certain other documents relating to the Acquisition will shortly be available to view on the Company's website at www.takeda.com/investors/offer-for-shire.\\n \\n\\n ###\\n \\n\\nAbout Takeda Pharmaceutical Company\\n \\n\\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502) is a global, research and development-driven pharmaceutical company committed to bringing better health and a brighter future to patients by translating science into life-changing medicines.

FILE PHOTO: Takeda Pharmaceutical Co's logo is seen at its new headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, July 2, 2018. REUTERS/ Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo   Shares in London-listed Shire rose 3 percent on the news, hitting their highest level since Takeda first disclosed its interest in buying the rare diseases specialist in March.    The deal would be the biggest-ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company - but it needs two-thirds support from shareholders, some of whom are worried about the enlarged company’s resulting debt burden. Takeda said on Monday it would hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of shareholders to vote on the transaction on Dec. 5. Previously, Takeda had said it hoped to hold the EGM early in 2019, leaving uncertain the level of backing for the deal, which has been opposed by some members of the founding Takeda family. “ Weber — a Frenchman and the first non-Japanese CEO of the company — believes that buying Shire will accelerate Takeda’s growth and increase its international reach, boosting earnings. The transaction is still awaiting approval from European regulators, although two people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Takeda was set to win conditional EU antitrust approval. Takeda has offered to divest Shire’s experimental drug SHP647 to address concerns about overlap in inflammatory bowel disease treatments.    The takeover has already secured clearance from regulators in the United States, Japan, China and Brazil. Weber said last week he was confident of securing investor backing for the purchase of Shire, but until now it has not been clear when exactly Takeda would call its EGM. Takeda, which has a market value of around $32 billion, has secured a $30.9 billion bridge loan to help finance the Shire acquisition and some investors are concerned as to how well it will cope with debt repayments. The Japanese company struck its agreement to take over Shire in May, in a deal that will propel it into the top 10 rankings of global drugmakers by sales.</td>\n",

But the Japanese pharmaceutical may face criticism by some of its shareholders who regard the $59 billion agreement, announced May 8 and amounting to the biggest-ever Japanese acquisition of a foreign company, as too costly.\\n\\n\\n Takeda said in a press release Monday it is aiming to win shareholder approval for an issue of new shares to finance the acquisition and complete the acquisition Jan. 8, subject to necessary regulatory and shareholder approval. The acquisition of Shire will create a company “with the financial strength to continue investing in delivering highly innovative medicines and transformative care to patients around the world,” Takeda President and Chief Executive Officer Christophe Weber said in the press release. Through the acquisition of Dublin-based Shire, known for its strength in developing drugs for hemophilia and other rare diseases, Takeda will become the world’s ninth-largest drugmaker, boasting combined sales of ¥2.81 trillion. Takeda will hold the shareholders meeting in the city of Osaka. Shire is expected to convene a meeting of its shareholders the same day. \\n\\n</td>\n",

Compelling Strategic and Financial Rationale for the Acquisition\\n\\n\\n      Takeda also reaffirms the compelling strategic and financial rationale \\n      for the Acquisition:\\n    \\n\\n\\n         The Acquisition will create a global, values-based, R&amp;D-driven \\n        biopharmaceutical company incorporated and headquartered in Japan, \\n        with an attractive geographic footprint and leading positions in Japan \\n        and the United States, respectively the third and first largest \\n        pharmaceutical markets globally.\\n      \\n\\n         The Acquisition will strengthen Takeda’s presence across two of its \\n        three core therapeutic areas - gastroenterology (GI) and neuroscience \\n        – and provide leading positions in rare diseases and plasma-derived \\n        therapies. Following completion of the Acquisition, Takeda will \\n        continue to focus on the acceleration of its oncology business, \\n        following its recent acquisition of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals. In \\n        addition, Takeda’s vaccine business will continue to address the \\n        world’s most pressing public health needs.\\n      \\n\\n         The Acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to \\n        underlying earnings per Takeda share from the first full fiscal year \\n        following completion and to produce strong combined cashflows. The \\n        Acquisition is also expected to be earnings accretive per Takeda share \\n        on a reported basis within three years post completion.\\n      \\n\\n         The Acquisition is expected to result in attractive returns for Takeda \\n        shareholders, with the return on invested capital (ROIC) expected to \\n        exceed Takeda's cost of capital within the first full fiscal year \\n        following completion.\\n      \\n\\n\\n 1 Related reports can be found in the \\n      Rule 2.7 Announcement made by Takeda on May 8, 2018, as well as \\n      information regarding the method of calculation of the synergies and the \\n      costs to achieve such synergies.\\n    \\n\\n\\n         The substantial cash flow generation expected to result from the \\n        Acquisition will enable the combined group to de-lever quickly \\n        following completion. Takeda intends to maintain its investment grade \\n        credit rating with a target net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.0x \\n        or less within three to five years following completion of the \\n        Acquisition, without the need to issue new shares. To help accelerate \\n        the de-leveraging process and ensure an optimal business mix, Takeda \\n        will consider selected disposals of non-core assets.\\n      \\n\\n         An enlarged and well-positioned combined portfolio will strengthen the \\n        combined group’s ability to invest in the business and deliver returns \\n        to Takeda shareholders. Takeda’s dividend policy has remained \\n        consistent over the past 9 years, with an annual dividend of JPY 180 \\n        per share having been paid to Takeda shareholders. Takeda has remained \\n        disciplined with respect to the terms of the Acquisition and intends \\n        to maintain its well-established dividend policy of JPY 180 per share.\\n      \\n\\n         The Acquisition is expected to result in Takeda being the only \\n        pharmaceutical company listed on both the Tokyo Stock Exchange in \\n        Japan, where it will continue to have its primary listing, and the New \\n        York Stock Exchange in the U.S., enabling it to access two of the \\n        world’s largest capital markets.\\n      \\n\\n\\n Shire Scheme Document and Shareholder Meetings\\n\\n\\n       Takeda also notes that Shire has today published its scheme document \\n      (the “Scheme Document”) in relation to the Acquisition and plans to hold \\n      its shareholder meetings in connection with the Acquisition on December \\n      5, 2018, following Takeda’s EGM.\\n    \\n\\n       The Scheme Document and certain other documents relating to the \\n      Acquisition will shortly be available to view on the Company's website \\n      at www.takeda.com/investors/offer-for-shire.\\n    \\n\\n       ###\\n    \\n\\nAbout Takeda Pharmaceutical Company\\n\\n\\n      Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502) is a global, research \\n      and development-driven pharmaceutical company committed to bringing \\n      better health and a brighter future to patients by translating science \\n      into life-changing medicines.

In such event, the Takeover Offer will be implemented on substantially the same terms, so far as applicable, as those which would apply to the Scheme, subject to appropriate amendments to reflect the terms of the Co-operation Agreement and, among other things, the change in structure by which the Acquisition is to be implemented and compliance with all applicable laws, including US securities laws. Restricted JurisdictionsThe release, publication or distribution of this Announcement in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom and Jersey may be restricted by law and therefore any persons into whose possession this Announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom and Jersey should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable requirements.

This Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with Jersey law, the Takeover Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this Announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws and regulations of jurisdictions outside Jersey. Unless otherwise determined by Takeda or required by the Takeover Code, and permitted by applicable law and regulation, the Acquisition will not be made available, directly or indirectly, in, into or from a Restricted Jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. No person may vote in favour of the Acquisition by any use, means, instrumentality or form, and the Acquisition will not be capable of acceptance, from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this Announcement and any formal documentation relating to the Acquisition are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from a Restricted Jurisdiction, where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction, and persons receiving this Announcement and all documents relating to the Acquisition (including custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise distribute or send them in, into or from Restricted Jurisdictions, where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation) the Takeover Offer may not be made directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of mails or any means or instrumentality (including but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of any Restricted Jurisdiction and the Takeover Offer may not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities. The availability of the New Takeda Securities under the Acquisition to Shire Shareholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom or Jersey, or the ability of those persons to continue to hold such securities, may be affected by the laws or regulatory requirements of the relevant jurisdiction in which they are resident. Persons into whose possession this Announcement comes who are not resident in the United Kingdom should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable requirements. Shire Shareholders who are in any doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The New Takeda Securities may not be offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or to, or for the account or benefit of, any Restricted Overseas Persons except pursuant to an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, applicable securities laws of those jurisdictions, or otherwise permitted under applicable securities laws of those jurisdictions. Further details in relation to Shire Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens of, jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom and Jersey will be contained in the Scheme Document. Additional information for US investorsNotice to US investors in Shire: the Acquisition relates to the shares of a Jersey company and is being made by means of a scheme of arrangement provided for under the Jersey Companies Law. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules or the proxy solicitation rules under the US Exchange Act, and it is expected that any New Takeda Securities to be issued pursuant to the Scheme to Shire Shareholders would be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements under the US Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof. Under applicable US securities laws, persons (whether or not US persons) who are or will be “affiliates ” (within the meaning of Rule 144 of the US Securities Act) of Takeda prior to, or after, the Effective Date will be subject to certain transfer restrictions relating to the New Takeda Securities received in connection with the Acquisition. Accordingly, the Acquisition is subject to the disclosure requirements and practices applicable in the United Kingdom and Jersey to schemes of arrangement which differ from the disclosure requirements of United States tender offer and proxy solicitation rules and the US Securities Act. If, in the future, Takeda exercises the right to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer and determines to extend the offer into the United States, the Acquisition will be made in compliance with applicable United States laws and regulations, including any applicable exemptions under the US Exchange Act. Financial information included in this Announcement and the Scheme Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom and Jersey that may not be comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP.The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Shire Shares pursuant to the Scheme will be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes. Each Shire Shareholder is urged to consult his independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax consequences of the Acquisition applicable to him, including under applicable United States state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. It may be difficult for US holders of Shire Shares to enforce their rights and any claim arising out of the US federal laws, since Takeda and Shire are located primarily in a non-US jurisdiction, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of a non-US jurisdiction. US holders of Shire Shares may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. New Takeda Securities issued pursuant to the Scheme will not be registered under any US state securities laws and may only be issued to persons resident in a state pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities laws of such state. For the purpose of qualifying for the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the US Securities Act, Shire will advise the Court that its sanctioning of the Scheme will be relied on by Takeda as an approval of the Scheme following a hearing on its fairness to Shire Shareholders, at which Court hearing all Shire Shareholders are entitled to attend in person or through counsel to support or oppose the sanctioning of the Scheme and with respect to which notification will be given to all such holders.

In order to be valid, the YELLOW Form of Proxy must be received by Equiniti not later than 11.30 a.m. on (3 ) December 3, 2018 (or, if the Shire General Meeting is adjourned, not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the adjourned Shire General Meeting). If either the Court Meeting or the Shire General Meeting is adjourned, the Voting Record Time for the relevant adjourned Shire Meeting will be 6.30 p.m. on the date falling two calendar days before the date (4 ) appointed for such adjourned Shire Meeting and the ADS Voting Record Time for the relevant adjourned Shire Meeting will be such later date as may be notified by the Shire Depositary, having consulted with Shire. In the event that the Takeda Extraordinary General Meeting is postponed or adjourned, the Court Meeting (5 ) and Shire General Meeting will be adjourned so that they will take place on the same date as the Takeda Extraordinary General Meeting. (6 ) To commence at 11.30 a.m. (London time) or as soon thereafter as the Court Meeting shall have concluded or been adjourned. If it becomes necessary to change any of the dates and/or times in the expected timetable, including as a result of the timing of receipt of approval from the European Commission to proceed to completion of the Acquisition, it is intended that the Effective Date will be as soon as practicable after January 8, 2019. Shire will give adequate notice of any changes by issuing an announcement through a Regulatory Information Service and will furnish such announcement to the SEC on Form 8-K. In order to avoid a delay in the completion of any such transfer, Shire Shareholders who make a valid (8 ) JASDEC Election to deliver their New Takeda Shares into an account with an AMI should contact their AMI to confirm any necessary steps in order for the AMI to record the delivery of the New Takeda Shares from the Settlement Account. The date on which New Takeda ADSs will be delivered to Shire Shareholders will depend on the type of ADS Election made. In order to avoid a delay in receiving their New Takeda ADSs, Shire Shareholders who make (9 ) a valid ADS Election to deliver their New Takeda ADSs to their broker or other securities intermediary in DTC should contact their broker or other securities intermediary to request that it, or the DTC participant through which it clears, inputs valid instructions to receive delivery of the New Takeda ADSs free of payment from the Takeda Depositary’s DTC participant account (account number 2504). New Takeda ADSs will be delivered to the Shire Depositary from January 10, 2019 (and in any event not later than 14 calendar days after the Effective Date). The date on which New Takeda ADSs will be delivered to Shire ADS Holders will depend on the way in which such Shire ADS Holders held their Shire ADSs. It is expected that Shire ADS Holders holding through (10 ) participants in DTC will receive delivery shortly after the receipt by the Shire Depositary of the New Takeda ADSs and that registered Shire ADS Holders holding uncertificated Shire ADSs (that is, Shire ADSs held outside of DTC for which no certificates have been issued) will be issued New Takeda ADSs in uncertificated form beginning approximately one week thereafter (and will receive a statement by post reflecting the issuance of New Takeda ADSs in their name). Registered Shire ADS Holders holding certificates for their Shire ADSs will only receive delivery of their New Takeda ADSs after they return their signed letter of transmittal and Shire ADS certificate to the Shire Depositary. The listing of, and commencement of regular-way dealings in, New Takeda ADSs on January 11, 2019 is subject to DTC having completed its allocation of New Takeda ADSs to former Shire ADS Holders and the (11 ) Shire Depositary having made the relevant notification to the New York Stock Exchange in time for the New York Stock Exchange to make the relevant announcement prior to close of business (New York time) on January 10, 2019. Shire Shareholders who hold Shire Shares in uncertificated form and receive the cash portion of the Consideration in US Dollars must ensure that an active US Dollar Cash Memorandum Account is in place in (12 ) CREST by no later than the Scheme Record Time. In the case of Shire ADS Holders who hold Shire ADSs in certificated form, subject to presentation by such holders of their signed letters of transmittal and Shire ADS certificates to the Shire Depositary. (14 ) The latest date by which the Scheme may become Effective may be extended by agreement in writing between Shire and Takeda with the prior consent of the Panel and (if required) the approval of the Court.

REUTERS/ Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo   BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T) is set to win conditional EU antitrust approval for its $62-billion bid for London’s Shire, the biggest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.   Last month, Takeda offered to divest Shire Plc’s pipeline compound SHP647 along with some associated rights after the European Commission voiced concerns about the overlap with its own drug for inflammatory bowel disease called Entyvio. Entyvio, a treatment for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is Takeda’s biggest-selling drug. Shire’s shares moved into positive territory in London following the Reuters story, closing up 0.28 percent. Its U.S. listed shares (SHPG.O) recovered some earlier losses after the story. Takeda is looking to the acquisition to boost its late-stage pipeline. Rare disease specialist Shire has seven drug candidates in Phase 3 clinical trials compared to its three. The deal would also make it a global top 10 drugmaker. The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to rule on the deal by Nov. 20, and Takeda declined to comment. Shire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Takeda has already secured unconditional clearance from regulators in the United States, Japan, China and Brazil.
